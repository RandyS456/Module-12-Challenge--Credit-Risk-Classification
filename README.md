# Module-12-Challenge-Credit-Risk-Classification
Challenge: Credit Risk Classification- In this Challenge, we use various techniques to train and evaluate models with imbalanced classes

### Module-12-Challenge-Credit-Risk-Classification
Challenge: Crypto Clustering-In this Challenge, we combine our financial Python programming skills with the new unsupervised learning skills acquired in this module.

The CSV file provided for this challenge contains price change data of cryptocurrencies in different periods.

The steps for this challenge are broken out into the following sections:

Import the Data (provided in the starter code) Prepare the Data (provided in the starter code) Find the Best Value for k Using the Original Data Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the Original Data Optimize Clusters with Principal Component Analysis Find the Best Value for k Using the PCA Data Cluster the Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the PCA Data Visualize and Compare the Results
